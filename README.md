# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

.Software engineering is the development of softwares for devices and computers
*software engineering is important because it helps develop reliable software solutions 
*software engineering is important to develop methods and structures in ensuring security
*software engineering is important to develop high quality reliable software for morden businesses

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

*automation (manualised machines are now automated which makes life easier)
*machine learning (machines and computers are able to learn grasp and perfom functions without human interferance)
*User experience (users experience effective and easy way of using machines and the reliability of it)
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

.planning ( defining requirements and the projects architecture)
coding (write code to provide instruction to carry out functions)
.testing (making sure everything functions as intended)
.deployment (put product to production so it reaches end user)

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

*waterfall methodology(is a linear,sequencial approach to break down development into phases  
*Agile methothodology(focuses on flexible and incremental development,breaks product into small builds,helps identify problems early on)

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

.Software developer create and maintain software applications and systems for computers and mobile devices.
.Quality assurance engineer ensures every aspect of a product adheres tp the organizations specified quality standards and requirements before a release.
.Project manager is responsible for leading the team,planning and executing software projects ensuring they are complete on time,within budget

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
.they help programmers be more productive,and write better code and reduce errors 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Evolving customer demand =Constant updrades and updates of model at a specific short period 
Communication conflict =maintain simpl and clear communiction taking notesbto be later reviewed between parties 
System integration =Always have a backup whiles the upgrade is still under development 1 step ahead 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Intergration testing focuses on how different components of a system testinginteract with each other and the are important beacause they validate the entire system 
Acceptance testing ensures the systems meets the needs of the end user and business by testing it in a real-world senario 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
The proccess of writting instructions to get the best AI model results 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

"write a song for me"
"write a romantic song for me sang by a lady for her husband"
